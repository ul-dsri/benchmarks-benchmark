\section{Appendix A. Definitions and Criteria}
Threats to reliability and responses may be submitted for inclusion in the benchmark by opening an issue on the associated repository. Discussion will follow to seek consensus on the risk and mitigations inclusion, whereupon the benchmark may be updated. Currently adopted threats and mitigations may also be adopted in this manner.
